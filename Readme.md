#This is my readme file to explain this react project

I wanted to build a react project that used chart functions from syncfusion. This was with the help of JS Mastery at https://www.jsmastery.pro/
I was able to learn how to integrate charts using syncfusion as well as tailwind to create custom styles. Using tailwind helped me keep the design symetric and uniform. 
This was a base project that could turn into so much more for a company needing a dashboard webpage.
